# 15-641: Networking and the Internet

Standard network course. The professor(Justine Sherry) was very nice and she showed a lot of passion! It was not easy to get high grades in exam, imo. A lot of knowledge covered and they required some degree of "boring" memorization.

The projects were hard. I was lucky to have a great team member who did a lot of work, and I can feel it would be much more painful without her. A lof of dirty programming involved. 

I need to mention the notorious Chinese companies again: in China's CS education system, network is a "must", and every Chinese company asks interview questions about it; but in the US I've not encountered even once that network is asked in interview, so this course's usefulness on job searching really depends.
