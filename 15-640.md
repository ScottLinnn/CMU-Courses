# 15-640: Distributed Systems (Spring version)

This course can be very different(project-wise) in spring and fall, this document is for the spring version.

Spring version was taught by [Satya](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/), who was deeply involved in the AFS project and had unique(in a good way) style of teaching. The course covered many aspects of distributed systems, can be pretty useful for interviews.(Among various system courses, I think distributed system has the highest relevance with job interview. However if you are interviewing with Chinese companies, then OS and network are more important.)

Projects were not hard generally, probably because most of them were in Java. However the load-balancing project(3-tier web server) was a bit frustrating because it felt more about magical parameter tuning and hard to get full score. 

TAs changed their OHs _very frequently_ - the most frequent I've ever seen, it felt like they were not very serious about their responsibility.
