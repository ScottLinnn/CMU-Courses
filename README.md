# CMU-Courses

I've taken a bunch of CS courses at CMU. There are a lot of people switching from other majors to CS nowadays (and this trend doesn't seem to slow down). As a guy who didn't major in a tech-related subject in undergrad, I want to share how I feel about the courses here, hopefully this can be helpful for folks.

(If you wonder how I switched from my previous major(architecture) to study CS at CMU, you can check my CV in [my profile](https://github.com/ScottLinnn).)
