# 17-514: Principles of Software Construction

This course was more aligned to industry - it talked about a lot of things you might use in internship, such OOP, design patterns, good programming practices, writing tests, CI/CD, framework, etc. The projects were more like "making interesting apps", which is less challenging than system courses' projects but might be more useful for looking for jobs. 

Design pattern was definitely the most important thing in this course, most of the final exam questions were asking about design patterns. 

Overall it was not hard for CS beginners, because we were using higher-level languages/tools most of the time.

I think the projects were still be too simple to put on resume. If you can add more features to it to make it more complex/cooler it would be okay.
