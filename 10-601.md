# 10-601: Introduction to Machine Learning

This course covered **many** ML concepts, specifically a variety of models. This course was more about breadth rather than depth, so if you are particularly interested in some specific models(like transformer or LLM), this course is probably not a fit for you.

The knowledge/skills developed in this course are mostly mathematical. They made a lot of programming hw, but the key to solve the hws was figuring out the math of the models rather than writing good code. It felt like they wanted to make this course more like a CS course but eventually it was still more like a math course.

As for difficulty, this course covered _basic_ ML concepts so they were intuitive to understand, but what might be difficult for some people is handling a lot of math equations. For example I peronsally don't like reading and writing those equations. (Luckily, now we have capable LLMs with multimodality, which presumably can help us read and write those equations easily!)
