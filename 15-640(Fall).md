# 15-640: Distributed Systems (TA)

This course's spring and fall versions are pretty different, and I was lucky to TA the fall version after taking the spring version, so I can talk about them both.

In terms of knowledge/lecture materials, although they both cover a lot of essential things(communication, consensus, DFS, ACID, failure/recovery), 
there are some notable differences. The spring version feels more traditional - focusing on classical design/algorithms, and the fall version is more 
aggressive, covering a wider range of topics and they are more modern/industry. Although the latter might better for job interview, its downside is you go through
too many things in a relatively shallow level.

Additionally, I think the spring version talks too much about caching and the fall version talks too much about network(especially obvious for me cuz I was taking 
641 simultaneously), probably due to the influence by professors(Satya taught spring version and he worked on AFS, Peter taught fall version and he previously taught network/641).
This difference on background is also indicated in projects: spring has a distributed caching project, and fall has a "LSP" project which is basically mini TCP.

It's a smooth transition to talk about projects now. The fall version has a LSP I just mentioned, a simple MapReduce-like project, a Raft(yeah, like MIT 6.824), and 
a Message-queue like project(if I remember correctly). I think the projects are not hard if you ignore the language - but that's the game changer! What makes fall projects 
harder than spring projects imo is Golang. Most people are not familar with it, so designing channels and handling `select` can be pretty hard. Although fall projects are harder, 
they should be more useful for job searching. (nowadays every student in China self-studies 6.824 and has a Raft project on their resume!)
