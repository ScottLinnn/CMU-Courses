# 15-513: Introduction to Computer Systems

Before I took this course, I had literally **no** programming background except some self-learning on Java and DSA from [UCB 61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es/). Some people rather took courses like [CMU 112](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/) as their first CS courses. After some thinking I decided to took 513 (and 514) anyway.

Luckily this course didn't turn out to be hard for me. More precisely, the course was hard on its _breadth_ rather than _depth_, so during the process each piece of knowledge was easy to understand, but in the final I found I forgot a lot of things because there were so much to remember! (In contrast, 15-645 is hard on **both** dimensions!)

A lof of people put malloc project on their resume. If you really need things to fill resume, like how I was at that time, I think it's okay to use it; otherwise it's not a good choice because **way too many people** put malloc on their resume.（If you are to interview with a Chinese company, they might ask you "is your malloc concurrent?" or "what's the underlying system call used by malloc?", be prepared for such questions!）

The course quality is super high, it's easy to perceive it's a very mature, well-developed course. This is what I think "how a course should be like".
